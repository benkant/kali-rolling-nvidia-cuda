# Omit useless

Take a fresh Kali and give it CUDA powers:

1. install Kali
2. first boot
  1. turn off the desktop image and make the background #808080 cos I said so
  2. `./after_first_boot.sh` which will do some computer things and reboot
3. now install the FUCK YOU NVIDIA
  1. log in
  2. `./after_after_first_boot.sh`
