# Omit needless

Take a fresh Kali and give it CUDA powers:

- install Kali
- first boot:
  - turn off the desktop image and make the background `#808080` cos I said so
  - `./after_first_boot.sh` which will do some computer things and reboot
- now install the FUCK YOU NVIDIA
  - get a **Diet Coke** from the fridge
  - log in
  - `./after_after_first_boot.sh`
  - Enjoy the *Crisp Taste* of **Diet Coke** with *No Calories*
  
> Omit needless means nothing can be added or removed without making this worse.
